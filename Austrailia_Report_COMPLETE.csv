● Restricted Electrical Licence in relevant jurisdiction
● Occupational Health and Safety white card.","Electrical fitters manufacture, assemble, test, alter and repair electrical equipment, wiring and other components in a plant or machinery context. This equipment is above extra-low voltage and fitters are not authorised to install any electrical wiring systems in accordance with the Australian/New Zealand Wiring Rules. They examine wiring diagrams and specifications and use electrical/electronic equipment to analyse and find faults in systems.","● Electrical fitters will need to build an understanding of the gas trades, as well as hydrogen’s unique properties and risks
● Depending on the type of plant being constructed, they may need certification to engage with high voltage power electronics (e.g. substations, transformers)
● Stakeholder consultations with engineering, procurement and construction firms noted that, given the multidisciplinary nature of hydrogen projects, a mutual understanding of electrical and gas fitting systems is needed."
Electrical Engineer,"Production, Transport and Distribution, Blending into Gas Networks, Transport Fuel","● Engineers Australia membership (inc. accredited degree as specified)
● Bachelor’s Degree or higher in Electrical Engineering
● At least five years experience in related projects.","Electrical engineers design and develop equipment and systems necessary for the generation and distribution of electrical power. They oversee the construction, installation and operation of these systems and equipment, and analyse the data arising from them. They may also be responsible for their ongoing maintenance and any problem solving required to ensure optimal performance.","● In some cases, electrical engineers will be expected to work with large high voltage power electronics used to supply energy to hydrogen production plants (e.g. substations, transformers)
● In design and planning, electrical engineers will need to recognise the importance of hazardous areas and the danger of ignition sources when designing hydrogen production and storage facilities
● Integration of electric vehicle drivetrains with hydrogen fuel cells will also be critical in certain sectors of industry, though this expertise may take some years to fully build within the market given the overseas location of the majority of fuel cell manufacturers."
Control Room Officer,"Production, Blending into Gas Networks","● Certificate IV in ESI Generation – Operations
● At least three years post-trade experience in related projects.","Control room officers monitor operations within a power plant to ensure they function as intended. They identify abnormal plant operating conditions and equipment, track and log data for all operational systems, and communicate to other operators recommended changes to improve plant performance, reliability and overall output.","● Control room officers will face little to no change to their responsibilities, as the fundamental tasks and processes of their work will remain unaltered
● However, they may need to build domain knowledge in order to understand the interchangeability of hydrogen with other gases (in this case natural gas) and the properties on which it differs, such as its calorific content
● They would also need knowledge of hydrogen storage techniques and the risks that come with handling it in its various forms, (e.g. its flammability and high compression when stored as a gas, and the need for low temperatures for storage when it is liquefied)."
Commissioning Engineer,"Production, Transport and Distribution, Storage, Blending into Gas Networks","● Engineers Australia membership (inc. accredited degree as specified)
● Bachelor’s Degree or higher in an 
Engineering discipline or Computer Science
● At least five years experience in related projects.",Commissioning engineers are those who oversee the installation and testing of equipment near the conclusion of a project. They inspect the functioning of facilities and plants to confirm they meet project specifications and the broader compliance environment. They verify these elements and give final approval to a project.,"● Commissioning engineers will need to understand the breadth of production and storage methods for hydrogen, such as electrolysis, steam methane reformation, and in the short term, coal gasification
● Liquefaction of hydrogen and storage in this liquefied form will change the material handling systems and processes
● They will also need an understanding of high pressure gas systems and vessels, as these are necessary when storing or transporting hydrogen."
Civil Engineer,"Production, Transport and Distribution, Blending into Gas Networks","● Engineers Australia membership (inc. accredited degree as specified)
● Bachelor’s Degree or higher in Civil Engineering
● At least five years experience in related projects.","Civil engineers oversee the planning, design and construction of large structures such as plants, pipelines, and gas supply schemes. They also examine the operations of these structures, and test their materials for durability and integrity. They are responsible for project management activities, including ensuring activities run according to schedule, cost and labour constraints.","● When planning structures that will house hydrogen and consider their environmental impact, civil engineers will need familiarity with hydrogen’s property risks and the various production and storage methods available for hydrogen
● Knowledge of high pressure gas systems will be critical to fully account for all safety considerations inherent to working with hydrogen
● A familiarity with power electronics may also be needed in hydrogen plant design."
Chemical Engineer,"Production, Transport and Distribution, Storage, Blending into Gas Networks, Export Fuel","● Engineers Australia membership 
(inc. accredited degree as specified)
● Bachelor’s Degree or higher in Chemical Engineering
● At least five years experience in related projects.","Chemical engineers are expected to design and develop chemical production processes that transform raw materials in a range of contexts. Their work includes designing and preparing specifications for chemical processes, and the construction and planning of chemical plants. They may also be expected to supervise industrial processing and the fabricating of project materials.
Note: This job role is also seen as encapsulating materials sciences engineers and related specialisations.","● Knowledge of hydrogen’s property risks and interactions with various materials will be an expected part of a chemical engineers’ work
● Embrittlement and crack propagation caused by molecular interaction between steel and hydrogen will influence the materials that chemical engineers select on their project
● Business needs to find more efficient methods of storing, transporting and converting hydrogen to other forms or compounds will require chemical engineers to advise others on the relative advantages and disadvantages of hydrogen’s various states in terms of calorific and heating content, and its interchangeability with other chemicals (e.g. gases)."
Automotive Electrician,Transport Fuel,"● Certificate IV in Automotive Electrical Technology
● Experience with Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) may be required.","Automotive electricians install, maintain and repair electrical wiring and electronic components in motor vehicles. They dismantle and remove electrical/electronic components and assemblies. They test, repair and replace faulty components, and connect power-operated vehicle equipment and accessories to a power supply.","● They will need a basic understanding of the operations and functions of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, including their limitations and when replacement may be necessary 
● Automotive electricians will need to work with high voltage systems, including learning how to depower them so that repair or maintenance work can be undertaken
● In some cases, automotive electricians may need to have a familiarity of different supplier parts that have been integrated into the electric vehicle’s assemblies. This may assist with diagnostic fault-finding and testing."
